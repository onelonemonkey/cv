## Personal Statement
I’m a passionate interface/front-end developer with a diverse 18 years career specialising in web standards and accessibility. 

Comfortable both working in distributed global teams or mixing it up in the daily scrum in a breakout. As a good communicator I love to come up with new ideas and also mentor others.  Scalability and performance rank high on my agenda and building systems over pages will always be a priority.

As a strong advocate for best practices within the industry I've been running [The Highland Fling - Web Standards in Scotland](http://thehighlandfling.com) since 2007 and more recently have become involved in a new industry body for web in the UK called [Web Matters](https://web-matters.co.uk) where I am now an active member of the steering committee.

I pride myself on being a champion for end users, the code bases I work on, the industry I work in and the clients I work for.

## Key Skills

## Hobbies

Outside of making the web, when I'm not having fun with my kids, I like to spend my time dabbling in 3D printing, flying drones, I also mess around making music. I've also started a new experiment called [Claydates](https://claydates.co.uk) to disconnect from technology and spend more time with people. None of these things mentioned are mutually exclusive.
